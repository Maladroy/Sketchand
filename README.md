# Sketchand is a mini app that utilize tensorflow hand pose detection model to create a drawing application


Initially, this project was an experiment using Tensorflow's hand pose detection model to create a Vietnamese sign language translator. While it was functional, the method used to detect each word and letter proved to be inefficient and not scalable. Furthermore, as Vietnam does not have a national sign language, the project was deemed impractical on a larger scale.
